Website "Smarrig Restaurang" consists of 3 pages in general. There are 3 pages under "Galleri" menu option just to show several approaches to create gallery grid.

# Main page is just information page. It has no forms or similar

# Under menu option Galleri
- Galleri Grid - layout created using CSS grid. It doesn't work in MS Internet Explorer and MS Edge
- Galleri Flex - layout created using CSS flexbox. It works in modern browsers
- Galleri Float - layout created using CSS Float. Old technology but not the worst =)

# menu option Veckans Lunch
- Check language' switch buttons;
- Check button "SHow whole week's menu", both languages;
- Check button "Order" under menu list:
    - Fill in form and click "Send" button;
    - Try to send empty or wrong filled form;
    - Try to close or cancel form

# NOTE:
Week's menu output depends on day of week. Thereby if "Veckans lunch" page is opened on workdays, menu of a day will be opened. 
Restaurant doesn't serve week's lunch on weeked, so message about it is shown if this page is opened on weekend.

Enjoy testing =)
